# Human-Activity-Recognization
This project is to build a model that predicts the human activities such as Walking, Walking_Upstairs, Walking_Downstairs, Sitting, Standing or Laying given some time series data.

-  Applied classical ML models like logistic regression, linear SVC, kernel  on expert engineered features.
-  Built a simple LSTM model on the raw time series features.
